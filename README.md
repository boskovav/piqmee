PIQMEE (Phylodynamic Inference of Quasispecies Molecular Evolution and Epidemiology)
======

[![Test Status](https://github.com/boskovav/piqmee/workflows/PIQMEE%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/boskovav/piqmee/actions?query=workflow%3A%PIQMEE+tests%22)

PIQMEE is a [BEAST 2](http://www.beast2.org) package allowing for fast
inference of phylodynamics from dataset containing many sequence duplicates.
